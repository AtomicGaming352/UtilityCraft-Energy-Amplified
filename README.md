 A Utility Craft Extension thats adds a few machines and a heck ton of energy amplifying generators

Generators included in 1.0:

- Bio generator
  - has 4 tiers, uses organic materials to generate DE, special items like the biowaste,compost,and biomass are used in this generator
- Biowaste generator
  - has 4 tiers, upgraded version of Bio generator, only uses biowaste and compost yet multiplies the DE output of biowaste by 2.5x and multiplies the DE output of compost by 3x
- Advanced solar panels(T2 panels)
  - has 4 tiers, same as tier 1 solar panel but generates 5x the DE of a normal solar panel
- Lunar panel
  - has 4 tiers, same as a tier 1 solar panel but instead of generating DE in daytime it instead generates DE in nighttime

Machines included in 1.0:

- Bio macerator
  - accepts speed and energy upgrades (max of 8 each), breaks down organic matter to turn into either biowaste, compost, or biomass cheaply
- Scrapper
  - accepts speed and energy upgrades (max of 8 each), turns items into the "scrap" item
    > currently unobtainable

Items included in 1.0:

- Biomass
  - a new way of getting DE by putting it in the Bio generator, obtained by crafting or through the bio macerator
- Compost
  - the second/middle tier of crafting Biomass, can be used as a way to get power by using it in the Bio generator or Biowaste generator, can be obtained by crafting or through the bio macerator
- Biowaste
  - the first tier of crafting Biomass, can be used as a way to get power by using it in the Bio generator or Biowaste generator, can be obtained by crafting or through the bio macerator
- Scrap
  - no use yet, obtained by putting items in the scrapper
    > Currently unobtainable as the scrapper is also unobtainable
